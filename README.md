# Abbott Home Tuitions - Project Proposal

## Project Overview

**Abbott Home Tuitions** is a web-based platform designed to connect students and parents seeking home tuition services with qualified tutors offering personalized teaching. The platform operates as a **data-driven matching service** that facilitates meaningful connections between tutors and learners based on their profiles and requirements.

### Key Concept

The platform functions on a data collection model where both students/parents and tutors submit their comprehensive profiles through the website. The system then employs a matching algorithm to identify the best compatible pairs based on subject expertise, location, availability, academic level, and learning goals. The platform facilitates the initial connection; negotiations and service delivery occur directly between the parties.
